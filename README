Django-versionedcache is a cache backend for Django that:

 - uses MintCache (inspired heavily by http://www.djangosnippets.org/snippets/155/)
 - prepends settings.VERSION to any cache keyto allow gracefull update - you
   can deploy new version of your application without the need for restarting
   your memcached - two versions of the same app can coexist on one memcached
   cluster.
 - to use
     - put versionedcache.backend in settings.CACHE_BACKEND where you
       would normaly use memcached, the rest is the same (IP adresses, ports and
       options to memcached are passed along)
     - maintain a VERSION string in your settings, when you change it,
       versionedcache will use it to identify cache keys belonging to that
       specific version, just change it on update to start using new set of keys
     - see tests/unit_test/settings for example usage
