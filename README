Django-versionedcache is a cache backend for Django that:

 - uses MintCache (inspired heavily by http://www.djangosnippets.org/snippets/155/)
 - prepends settings.VERSION to any cache keyto allow gracefull update - you
   can deploy new version of your application without the need for restarting
   your memcached - two versions of the same app can coexist on one memcached
   cluster.
